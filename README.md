# Brace Forecast

## Introduction

There are hundreds of thousands of patients misdiagnosed for needing braces by centers so that they can be scammed out for money. We allow users to upload images of their teeth for which we have detailed instructions and an explanation of the process for what happens with that image.Upon receiving this image, we use Flask and Machine Learning collaboratively to compare the image with images in training/testing data as well as give them an accurate diagnosis. In addition, there are millions more who do not have access to healthcare or good health insurance so Brace Forecast can help them run a quick and easy but accurate diagnosis Furthermore, we recommend clinics near the user using an API that we have written ourselves and this way, they don’t have to worry about how to go about taking the next steps in clearing their teeth. All in all, Brace Forecast is the all in one solution for individuals inaccessible to healthcare, proper health insurance and those with concerns of misdiagnosis.
